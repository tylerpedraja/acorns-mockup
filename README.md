# acorns-mockup
mockup for Acorns Stairlifts

This mockup uses no frameworks or libraries, only vanilla HTML, CSS, and Sass. It uses BEM naming standards and 7-1 file structure for easy-reading and maintainability. Additionally, the grid structure is done with a combination of Flexbox and CSS grid. No Bootstrap or third-party grid systems were used. Please view the site on desktop for the best presentation. 

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
